# Banking Dashboard Project

# Overview
The Banking Dashboard Project is a data-driven initiative designed to analyze and visualize customer banking data, including deposits, loans, and account balances. Built using Python with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLAlchemy, and PyMySQL, alongside Power BI for advanced data visualization, this project transforms raw data from an Excel file into a MySQL database and generates both interactive visualizations in Jupyter Notebook and a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard in Power BI. These dashboards present key financial metrics and trends to assist financial analysts, bank managers, and data scientists in making informed decisions.

# Features

### Data Ingestion and Database Management

- Imports customer data from an Excel file into a MySQL database.
- Creates a banking database and `Customer` table using SQLAlchemy.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Correlation analysis on numerical columns (e.g., Bank Deposits, Checking Accounts, Loans).
- Heatmap visualization of correlation coefficients.

### Interactive Dashboard

- Visual breakdowns of deposits, loans, savings, credit cards, and business lending.
- Pie charts for income band distribution.
- Bar charts for categorical comparisons (nationality, occupation, banking relationship).

### Scalability

- Easily extendable to new data sources and metrics.
- Supports filtering and segmentation for deeper insights.
